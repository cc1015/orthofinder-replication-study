# orthofinder replication study

This project was a replication of a pipeline in the publication, [Ancient Gene Linkages Support Ctenophores as Sister to Other Animals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05936-6).

The repository contains the final slideshow and paper explaining the scientific background and technical replication of the OrthoFinder pipeline in the study. I performed all bash scripting and data analysis in the notebook file, and I completed the 'Methods' slides in the presentation.
